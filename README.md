TWEAKS:

1- GR_asym = 'n'

2- args  = (0.315, 5.44e-5, 1.013,  0.000, 0.674, 0.700, -1.000, 0.500)

These settings reproduce the singular behavior on \mu vs z.

Hypothesis: H(z) approaches zero at some point during integration.

Obs.: This may be (un)physically justified but further analysis of the validity of \Omega parameters combinations is required.
